Installs just like any other WordPress plugin.

Add the email shortcode [certificate_link] to your custom emails in the Event Espresso > General Settings  page OR when using Email Confirmation area when creating a new event or editing an existing event.

To display custom event details to the certificate, you can use the event meta fields (within the event editor), to output the custom data to the certificate. For example, if you add "number_credits" as a meta key, and add "6" to the value field, you can display the number of credits when the certificate is generated.

To display the answers to custom questions, that were input at the time of registration, you can use the name of the question prefixed with "answer_". For example, if you want to display the answer to a custom question, such as "License Number", you can add "[answer_License Number]" to the template.
